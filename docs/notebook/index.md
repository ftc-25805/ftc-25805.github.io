</div>

The engineering notebook is your team's technical diary - documenting the design process, decisions, and lessons learned.

## Purpose and Importance

### Why Keep a Notebook?
- **Award Eligibility** - Required for Think Award and others
- **Design Documentation** - Record of your engineering process
- **Knowledge Transfer** - Preserve team knowledge for future seasons
- **Problem Solving** - Track solutions and learn from mistakes
- **Professional Practice** - Mirror real-world engineering documentation

### What Judges Look For
- **Complete Design Process** - From conception to final robot
- **Engineering Analysis** - Calculations, testing, and validation
- **Clear Communication** - Easy to read and understand
- **Continuous Documentation** - Regular entries throughout season
- **Reflection and Learning** - What worked, what didn't, and why

## Notebook Structure

### Required Sections

- Sign and date all entries

## Digital vs Physical Notebooks

### Digital Notebooks
#### Advantages
- Easy to edit and revise
- Searchable content
- Easy photo integration
- Multiple backup copies
- Collaborative editing

#### Tools
- **Google Docs/Slides** - Collaborative platform

- Satisfying tactile experience
- Judge preference (sometimes)

#### Best Practices
- Use bound notebook (not loose-leaf)
- Write in permanent ink
- Cross out mistakes (don't erase)
- Number all pages
- Include table of contents
