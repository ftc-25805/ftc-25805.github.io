Master the mechanical engineering skills needed to design and build competitive FTC robots.

## Design Process

### 1. Game Analysis
- Study game manual thoroughly
- Identify key scoring opportunities
- Analyze field layout and constraints
- Research successful strategies from previous seasons

### 2. Strategy Development
- Define robot objectives and priorities
- Create design requirements
- Set performance targets
- Plan for iterative improvement

### 3. Conceptual Design
- Brainstorm multiple solutions
- Sketch initial ideas
- Consider trade-offs and constraints
- Select promising concepts for development

### 4. Detailed Design
- Create CAD models and technical drawings
- Specify materials and components
- Plan assembly sequences
- Conduct design reviews

### 5. Prototyping
- Build and test critical mechanisms
- Validate design assumptions
- Identify potential issues early
- Refine designs based on testing

## Core Mechanical Systems

### Drivetrain
The foundation of robot mobility:

#### Tank Drive
- **Simple and reliable** - Two independent wheel sets
- Easy to program and control
- Good for straight-line movement
- Turning requires differential speeds

#### Mecanum Drive
- **Omnidirectional movement** - Strafe in any direction
- Complex programming requirements
- Reduced traction compared to tank
- Excellent for precise positioning

#### Swerve Drive
- **Maximum maneuverability** - Each wheel steers independently
- Most complex to build and program
- Superior field positioning
- Advanced teams only

### Intake Systems
Collecting game elements efficiently:

#### Active Intakes
- Rotating wheels or belts
- Powered collection mechanism
- Fast and reliable
- Requires motor and control

#### Passive Intakes
- Fixed scoops or funnels
- No power required
- Simple and lightweight
- Limited to robot movement

### Lifting Mechanisms
Elevating game elements or robot:

#### Linear Slides
- Smooth vertical movement
- High precision positioning
- Popular for scoring mechanisms
- Requires proper tensioning

#### Arm Systems
- Rotational movement
- Large reach envelope
- Natural motion
- Consider joint strength

#### Scissor Lifts
- Compact when retracted
- Stable lifting platform
- Multiple linkage points
- Mechanical advantage

### Scoring Mechanisms
Getting game elements where they need to go:

#### Shooters
- High-speed projectile systems
- Consistent release mechanisms
- Flywheel or catapult systems
- Requires extensive tuning
