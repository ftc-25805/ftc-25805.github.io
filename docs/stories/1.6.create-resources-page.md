## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.5: Sponsorship page successfully created and added to navigation. Site branding and navigation structure well established. Development server confirmed working at http://localhost:3000/ with build process functioning correctly. Navigation structure working well in docusaurus.config.ts with logical ordering between About, Sponsorship, and Contact.

### Tech Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Frontend Framework**: Docusaurus 3.4.0 with React 18.3.1 for static site generation
- **Frontend Language**: TypeScript 5.5.3 for static typing
- **Styling**: Infima CSS Framework (bundled with Docusaurus) for consistent UI
- **Package Manager**: npm 10.8.1 for dependency management

### Project Structure Context

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

Key file locations for this story:

- New Resources page: `src/pages/resources.md` (standard Docusaurus page location)
- Navigation configuration: `docusaurus.config.ts` (main site configuration file)
- Custom global styling: `src/css/custom.css` (for any custom styling overrides)
- Static assets: `/static` directory (for any local guide files or images)

### Component Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

- **Route Organization**: Routing is handled automatically by Docusaurus's file-based routing system in the `src/pages` directory
- **Page Template**: All new pages should use Markdown format with proper frontmatter for page metadata
- **Navigation**: Navigation items are configured in the main `docusaurus.config.ts` configuration file
- **Component Template**: Pages should be functional components using TypeScript and React Hooks if React components are needed

### Data Models Context

[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

- No specific data models required for this story, as it's primarily a content page
- If future guide management is needed, content will be managed via filesystem using `.md` files in the Git repository

### Frontend Architecture Details

[Source: architecture/components.md]

- **Content Management Component**: Content is managed via filesystem using `.md` files in the Git repository
- **UI & Presentation Layer**: Provides visual presentation based on Infima framework
- **Docusaurus Build Engine**: Compiles content and configuration into optimized static website

### Core Workflows Context

[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]

- **Content Publishing Workflow**: The resources page follows the standard content publishing workflow where content is managed via Markdown files and automatically deployed through GitHub Actions

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **Global Styling**: All global custom styling must be done in `src/css/custom.css`
- **Static Assets**: All assets must be placed in the `/static` directory
- **MDX Usage**: Use `.mdx` extension for Markdown files that contain React components (but standard `.md` is fine for simple content pages)

### Configuration Context

[Source: previous story experience and docusaurus.config.ts structure]

The `docusaurus.config.ts` file contains the main navigation configuration in the `themeConfig.navbar.items` array. The Resources page should be added to this navigation structure following the existing pattern established in previous stories, positioned logically in the navigation order.

### Testing

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Requirements for this story**:

- **Manual Testing**: Verify resources page renders correctly in development server
- **Build Testing**: Ensure `npm run build` completes without errors
- **E2E Manual Process**: Test navigation links, verify guide links work, test YouTube video embedding and playback
- **No Unit Tests Required**: Simple content pages don't require component unit tests for MVP

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-16
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
Excellent implementation that fully meets all acceptance criteria with comprehensive content organization. The Resources page demonstrates solid understanding of Docusaurus patterns and provides valuable learning materials for the FTC team. The developer followed project structure guidelines correctly and implemented proper navigation integration.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: src/pages/resources.md → src/pages/resources.mdx
  - **Change**: Converted .md to .mdx extension and modernized iframe implementation
  - **Why**: JSX-style attributes require MDX support; follows coding standards for React components
  - **How**: Enables proper React component rendering and improves maintainability

- **File**: src/pages/resources.mdx
  - **Change**: Updated iframe attributes from deprecated `frameborder="0"` to `style={{ border: 0 }}`, added `referrerPolicy` and updated `allow` permissions
  - **Why**: Deprecated HTML attributes should be replaced with modern equivalents; improves security and accessibility
  - **How**: Better cross-origin security, follows React/JSX best practices, maintains same visual result

- **File**: src/pages/resources.mdx  
  - **Change**: Replaced broken example YouTube link with valid FTC documentation link
  - **Why**: Placeholder "example" URL was non-functional and poor user experience
  - **How**: Links to official FTC game-specific resources providing actual strategic guidance

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows coding standards perfectly; MDX usage now properly implemented
- Project Structure: ✓ Correct file location in src/pages/, proper frontmatter structure
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Manual testing approach appropriate for content page; build verification passed
- All ACs Met: ✓ Navigation added, guide links functional, YouTube video properly embedded

### Improvements Checklist
[All items handled during review - no outstanding tasks]

- [x] Fixed broken placeholder YouTube link (src/pages/resources.mdx)
- [x] Modernized iframe implementation with proper React/JSX attributes (src/pages/resources.mdx)
- [x] Converted to MDX for proper React component support (src/pages/resources.mdx)
- [x] Enhanced security with proper referrerPolicy and updated permissions (src/pages/resources.mdx)
- [x] Verified build process works correctly with all changes

### Security Review
Iframe implementation now uses proper `referrerPolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"` for enhanced security. YouTube embed is from trusted source with appropriate sandboxing via `allow` attributes. No security concerns identified.

### Performance Considerations
YouTube iframe uses standard embed approach with lazy loading handled by browser. Content is well-organized with clear section headers for optimal user experience. No performance issues identified.

### Final Status
✓ Approved - Ready for Done

Story implementation exceeds expectations with comprehensive resource organization and proper technical implementation. All refactoring completed successfully with no breaking changes.
