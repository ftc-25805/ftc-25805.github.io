## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.9: The current implementation has a working light theme with brand colors configured in `src/css/custom.css`. The project uses Docusaurus's Infima theming system with custom CSS variable overrides. All existing components (including the newly created YouTubeEmbed component) should automatically inherit the new dark theme styling.

### Tech Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md]

- **Framework**: Docusaurus ^3.x for static site generation with built-in theming support
- **Styling**: CSS Modules + Infima for component styling and theme management
- **Language**: TypeScript ^5.x for configuration and custom components
- **Testing**: Jest ^29.x + React Testing Library for component testing

### Styling Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/styling-guidelines.md]

**Global Theme Customization**: Brand-wide styles (colors, fonts) are configured in `src/css/custom.css` by overriding Docusaurus's Infima theme variables.

**Dark Theme Implementation Strategy**: The styling guidelines already specify the exact dark theme color scheme:

```css
:root {
  /* Brand Colors from UI/UX Spec */
  --ifm-color-primary: #9b59b6; /* Main brand purple */
  --ifm-color-secondary: #f1c40f; /* Accent yellow for highlights */
  --ifm-background-color: #1a1a1d; /* Dark charcoal gray */
  --ifm-font-color-base: #efefef; /* Light text for readability */
}
```

### Current Theme Configuration Analysis

[Source: current src/css/custom.css analysis]

**Current State**: The project currently has:

- Light theme configured as default with team brand colors (#242E6B primary)
- Dark theme override section with different purple variant (#C1A5F3)
- YouTube embed component styles that need to work with dark theme
- Existing brand fonts: Roboto and Exo 2 (from specification)

**Required Changes**:

1. Make dark theme the default by moving dark theme colors to `:root` section
2. Update color scheme to match Epic 2 specifications (#9b59b6 purple, #f1c40f yellow)
3. Ensure all existing component styles (YouTube embed error states) work with new colors

### Project Structure Context

[Source: architecture/project-structure.md]

**Key Files for This Story**:

- `src/css/custom.css` - Main stylesheet requiring theme variable updates
- `docusaurus.config.ts` - Site configuration for default theme setting
- All pages in `src/pages/` - Need verification with new theme
- All components in `src/components/` - Should inherit new theme automatically

### Docusaurus Theme Configuration Context

[Source: current docusaurus.config.ts analysis]

**Current Configuration**: Docusaurus is set to auto-detect user preference for light/dark theme. For this story, need to configure dark theme as the default while maintaining user choice capability.

**Theme Configuration Options**:

- `themeConfig.colorMode.defaultMode: 'dark'` - Sets dark as default
- `themeConfig.colorMode.disableSwitch: true` - Forces dark theme only (if desired)
- Current Prism themes work well with dark background

### Component Standards Context

[Source: architecture/component-standards.md]

**Component Integration**: All existing components use CSS Modules (`styles.module.css`) for component-specific styling. These should automatically inherit the new global dark theme variables without modification.

**YouTube Component Impact**: The existing YouTube embed component uses Infima color variables for error states, which will automatically update with the new theme colors.

### Testing

[Source: architecture/testing-requirements.md]

**Testing Requirements for this story**:

- **Unit Tests**: Create snapshot tests for components to verify dark theme rendering
- **Test Organization**: Test files co-located with components in `src/components/` directory
- **Component Testing**: Focus on verifying theme variable application and visual regression prevention
- **Accessibility Testing**: Manual verification of color contrast ratios for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

**Test File Locations**:

- Theme snapshot tests in `src/css/custom.test.ts` (if needed for theme validation)
- Component integration tests in existing component test files

**Manual Testing Requirements**:

- Cross-browser testing of dark theme appearance
- Color contrast validation using accessibility tools
- Verification across all existing pages and components
