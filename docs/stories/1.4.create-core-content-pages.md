## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.3: Homepage customization completed successfully. Site branding and navigation structure established. Homepage now includes proper team introduction and navigation to key sections. Development server confirmed working at http://localhost:3000/ with build process functioning correctly.

### Tech Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Frontend Framework**: Docusaurus 3.4.0 with React 18.3.1 for static site generation
- **Frontend Language**: TypeScript 5.5.3 for static typing
- **Styling**: Infima CSS Framework (bundled with Docusaurus) for consistent UI
- **Package Manager**: npm 10.8.1 for dependency management

### Project Structure Context

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

Key file locations for this story:

- New About page: `src/pages/about.md` (standard Docusaurus page location)
- New Contact page: `src/pages/contact.md` (standard Docusaurus page location)
- Navigation configuration: `docusaurus.config.ts` (main site configuration file)
- Custom global styling: `src/css/custom.css` (for any custom styling overrides)

### Component Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

- **Route Organization**: Routing is handled automatically by Docusaurus's file-based routing system in the `src/pages` directory
- **Page Template**: All new pages should use Markdown format with proper frontmatter for page metadata
- **Navigation**: Navigation items are configured in the main `docusaurus.config.ts` configuration file

### Frontend Architecture Details

[Source: architecture/components.md]

- **Content Management Component**: Content is managed via filesystem using `.md` files in the Git repository
- **UI & Presentation Layer**: Provides visual presentation based on Infima framework
- **Docusaurus Build Engine**: Compiles content and configuration into optimized static website

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **Global Styling**: All global custom styling must be done in `src/css/custom.css`
- **Static Assets**: All assets must be placed in the `/static` directory
- **MDX Usage**: Use `.mdx` extension for Markdown files that contain React components (but standard `.md` is fine for simple content pages)

### Configuration Context

[Source: previous story experience and docusaurus.config.ts structure]

The `docusaurus.config.ts` file contains the main navigation configuration in the `themeConfig.navbar.items` array. New pages should be added to this navigation structure following the existing pattern.

### Testing

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Requirements for this story**:

- **Manual Testing**: Verify both pages render correctly in development server
- **Build Testing**: Ensure `npm run build` completes without errors
- **E2E Manual Process**: Test navigation links and verify content displays properly
- **No Unit Tests Required**: Simple content pages don't require component unit tests for MVP
