## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.3: Homepage customization completed successfully. Site branding and navigation structure established. Homepage now includes proper team introduction and navigation to key sections. Development server confirmed working at http://localhost:3000/ with build process functioning correctly.

### Tech Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Frontend Framework**: Docusaurus 3.4.0 with React 18.3.1 for static site generation
- **Frontend Language**: TypeScript 5.5.3 for static typing
- **Styling**: Infima CSS Framework (bundled with Docusaurus) for consistent UI
- **Package Manager**: npm 10.8.1 for dependency management

### Project Structure Context

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

Key file locations for this story:

- New About page: `src/pages/about.md` (standard Docusaurus page location)
- New Contact page: `src/pages/contact.md` (standard Docusaurus page location)
- Navigation configuration: `docusaurus.config.ts` (main site configuration file)
- Custom global styling: `src/css/custom.css` (for any custom styling overrides)

### Component Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

- **Route Organization**: Routing is handled automatically by Docusaurus's file-based routing system in the `src/pages` directory
- **Page Template**: All new pages should use Markdown format with proper frontmatter for page metadata
- **Navigation**: Navigation items are configured in the main `docusaurus.config.ts` configuration file

### Frontend Architecture Details

[Source: architecture/components.md]

- **Content Management Component**: Content is managed via filesystem using `.md` files in the Git repository
- **UI & Presentation Layer**: Provides visual presentation based on Infima framework
- **Docusaurus Build Engine**: Compiles content and configuration into optimized static website

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **Global Styling**: All global custom styling must be done in `src/css/custom.css`
- **Static Assets**: All assets must be placed in the `/static` directory
- **MDX Usage**: Use `.mdx` extension for Markdown files that contain React components (but standard `.md` is fine for simple content pages)

### Configuration Context

[Source: previous story experience and docusaurus.config.ts structure]

The `docusaurus.config.ts` file contains the main navigation configuration in the `themeConfig.navbar.items` array. New pages should be added to this navigation structure following the existing pattern.

### Testing

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Requirements for this story**:

- **Manual Testing**: Verify both pages render correctly in development server
- **Build Testing**: Ensure `npm run build` completes without errors
- **E2E Manual Process**: Test navigation links and verify content displays properly
- **No Unit Tests Required**: Simple content pages don't require component unit tests for MVP

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-16
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
Excellent implementation of core content pages with comprehensive, professional content. The developer successfully created both About and Contact pages with proper Docusaurus structure and meaningful content. Navigation integration is clean and logical. Content improvements made to enhance professionalism and remove placeholder information that could confuse visitors.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: src/pages/about.md
  - **Change**: Fixed spelling of "Coopetition" (was "Coopertition")
  - **Why**: Maintain consistency with FIRST terminology across all pages for professional credibility
  - **How**: Corrected the official FIRST term to match previous fixes in homepage content

- **File**: src/pages/contact.md
  - **Change**: Replaced placeholder email addresses and contact details with professional messaging
  - **Why**: Placeholder emails (coach@teamreprogrammed.org, etc.) were non-functional and unprofessional
  - **How**: Updated with "contact available upon request" messaging and proper contact form references

- **File**: src/pages/contact.md
  - **Change**: Enhanced contact structure with clear contact form section and realistic contact methods
  - **Why**: Original placeholder structure lacked actionable contact methods for visitors

- **File**: src/pages/contact.md
  - **Change**: Improved meeting information structure with realistic scheduling approach
  - **Why**: Placeholder meeting times and locations provided no value to visitors
  - **How**: Updated with dynamic scheduling approach that reflects real team operations

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ Proper Markdown structure with correct frontmatter; files in appropriate src/pages location
- Project Structure: ✓ Pages correctly placed and navigation properly configured in docusaurus.config.ts
