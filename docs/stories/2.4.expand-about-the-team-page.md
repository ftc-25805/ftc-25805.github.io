## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.3: The project now has a fully implemented dark theme as the default with Epic 2 color specifications (#b377d1 purple primary, #f1c40f yellow accent). All new content should automatically inherit these theme variables through Infima's CSS system. The dark theme uses proper WCAG 2.1 AA compliant contrast ratios.

From Story 2.1: A consistent dark theme has been implemented site-wide using Infima theme variables in `src/css/custom.css`. All new components should follow this pattern for styling consistency.

### Tech Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md]

- **Framework**: Docusaurus ^3.x for static site generation
- **Language**: TypeScript ^5.x for all custom component code
- **UI Library**: React.js ^18.x for building custom components
- **Styling**: CSS Modules + Infima for component styling and theme management
- **State Management**: React Context API for any shared state if needed
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library ^29.x for unit testing custom React components

### Component Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/component-standards.md]

**Component Structure Requirements**:

- All components must follow the standard template with TypeScript interfaces
- Directory structure: `/src/components/ComponentName/` with `index.tsx` and `styles.module.css`
- Naming conventions: PascalCase for component files and functions
- Props must be defined with TypeScript interfaces
- Functional component pattern required

**Component Template Pattern**:

```typescript
// src/components/MyComponent/index.tsx
import React from 'react';
import styles from './styles.module.css';

export interface MyComponentProps {
  // ... props definition
}

export default function MyComponent({ prop }: MyComponentProps): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <div className={styles.myComponentContainer}>
      {/* component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Project Structure Context

[Source: architecture/project-structure.md]

**File Locations for New Components**:

- Team profile components: `/src/components/TeamMemberProfile/`, `/src/components/TeamMentorProfile/`, `/src/components/AlumniProfile/`
- About page location: `/src/pages/about.md` (existing file to be modified)
- Component styling: Each component directory contains `styles.module.css`
- Static assets: `/static/img/` for team member photos and images

**Existing Component Reference**:

- `/src/components/MemberCard/` - existing component that may serve as reference for team profile styling patterns
- `/src/components/SponsorShowcase/` - existing component showing multiple profile-style cards

### Styling Guidelines Context

[Source: architecture/styling-guidelines.md]

**Theme Integration Requirements**:

- Global theme variables available in `src/css/custom.css`
- Primary brand color: `--ifm-color-primary: #9b59b6` (purple)
- Secondary accent color: `--ifm-color-secondary: #f1c40f` (yellow)
- Dark theme background: `--ifm-background-color: #1a1a1d`
- Typography: Roboto base font, Exo 2 for headings
- Text color: `--ifm-font-color-base: #efefef` for readability

**CSS Modules Pattern**:

- Component-specific styles use CSS Modules (`styles.module.css`)
- Global theme variables can be referenced in CSS Modules
- Maintain consistency with existing component styling patterns

### Current About Page Context

[Source: src/pages/about.md analysis]

**Existing Content Structure**:

- Current content includes Mission, Values, Journey, and What We Do sections
- File uses standard markdown format with frontmatter
- Content is well-structured and should be preserved while adding new sections
- Current file is located at `/src/pages/about.md`

**Integration Strategy**:

- Convert existing about.md to about.mdx to support React component imports
- Preserve existing content while adding new team profile sections
- Add imports for new team profile components at top of file
- Structure new sections: Current Team Members, Mentors, Notable Alumni

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-requirements.md]

**Testing Standards**:

- Test files must be co-located: `/src/components/ComponentName/index.test.tsx`
- Use Jest + React Testing Library for component testing
- Test template pattern with describe blocks and user-centric tests
- Mock external dependencies for component isolation
- Test props rendering, user interactions, and accessibility

**Required Test Coverage**:

- Props interface validation
- Component rendering with different data sets
- CSS class application and styling
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, roles)
- Responsive behavior testing

**Test File Template**:

```typescript
// src/components/MyComponent/index.test.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import MyComponent, { MyComponentProps } from './index';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  const defaultProps: MyComponentProps = {
    // ... default props
  };

  it('renders correctly with given props', () => {
    render(<MyComponent {...defaultProps} />);
    // assertions
  });
});
```

### Data Structure Requirements

**Team Member Profile Interface** (inferred from AC requirements):

```typescript
interface TeamMemberProfile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  role: string;
  bio: string;
  photoUrl?: string;
  skills?: string[];
  joinDate?: string;
}
```

**Mentor Profile Interface** (inferred from AC requirements):

```typescript
interface MentorProfile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  title: string;
  bio: string;
  photoUrl?: string;
  expertise: string[];
  yearsWithTeam: number;
}
```

**Alumni Profile Interface** (inferred from AC requirements):

```typescript
interface AlumniProfile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  graduationYear: number;
  achievements: string[];
  currentPursuit: string;
  photoUrl?: string;
  bio: string;
}
```
