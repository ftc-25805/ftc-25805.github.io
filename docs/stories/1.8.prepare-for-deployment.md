## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.7: Development server confirmed working at http://localhost:3000/ with build process functioning correctly. Navigation structure is well established in docusaurus.config.ts with logical ordering between About, Blog, Sponsorship, Contact, and Resources. All previous stories have established a solid foundation with proper branding and content structure.

### Tech Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Frontend Framework**: Docusaurus 3.4.0 with React 18.3.1 for static site generation
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated build and deployment process
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages for static website hosting
- **Package Manager**: npm 10.8.1 for dependency management

### Project Structure Context

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

Key file locations for this story:

- **Main configuration**: `docusaurus.config.ts` (main site configuration file for deployment settings)
- **CI/CD workflow**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (CI/CD script for deploying to GitHub Pages)
- **Build output**: `build/` directory (generated static files for deployment)

### Deployment Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

**Deployment Strategy**:

- **Platform**: GitHub Pages
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: The `build` directory
- **CDN/Edge**: GitHub Pages service includes CDN by default

**GitHub Actions Configuration Requirements**:

- Workflow should trigger on push to main branch and manual dispatch
- Requires permissions: `contents: read`, `pages: write`, `id-token: write`
- Must use Nix development environment for build consistency
- Build process: `nix develop --command npm install` then `nix develop --command npm run build`
- Upload artifact from `./build` directory
- Deploy using `actions/deploy-pages@v4`

**Important Repository Context**:

- Repository name is `ftc-25805.github.io` (organization GitHub Pages site)
- This means `baseUrl` should be `/` (not `/project-name/`)
- Organization name is `ftc-25805`

### Configuration Context

[Source: current docusaurus.config.ts analysis]

Current configuration analysis:

- **URL**: Currently set to `https://ftc-25805.github.io` (correct for organization site)
- **baseUrl**: Currently set to `/` (correct for organization site)
- **organizationName**: Currently set to `ftc-25805` (correct)
- **projectName**: Currently set to `ftc-25805-website` (needs verification against actual repo name)
- **deploymentBranch**: Currently set to `gh-pages` (standard GitHub Pages deployment branch)

**Required Configuration Updates**:

- Verify `projectName` matches actual repository name (`ftc-25805.github.io`)
- Ensure all GitHub Pages deployment settings are properly configured

### Core Workflows Context

[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]

**Content Publishing Workflow**: The deployment will enable the automated workflow where team members push commits to the main branch, GitHub Actions automatically runs the build process, and the static site is deployed to GitHub Pages.

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Requirements for this story**:

- **Manual Testing**: Verify build process works correctly and generates proper static files
- **Build Testing**: Ensure `npm run build` completes without errors consistently
- **E2E Manual Process**: Test deployment configuration, verify static files are generated correctly
- **No Unit Tests Required**: Deployment configuration doesn't require component unit tests

### Configuration Details

**GitHub Pages Deployment Configuration** needed in `docusaurus.config.ts`:

- `url`: Must match GitHub Pages URL format
- `baseUrl`: For organization sites (\*.github.io), use `/`
- `organizationName`: Must match GitHub organization/username
- `projectName`: Must match repository name
- `deploymentBranch`: Standard is `gh-pages` for automated deployment

**GitHub Actions Workflow Requirements**:

- File location: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Trigger: Push to main branch and workflow_dispatch
- Environment: `github-pages` with proper URL output
- Steps: Checkout, Install Nix, Setup Pages, Install/Build with Nix, Upload artifact, Deploy
