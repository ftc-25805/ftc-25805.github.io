## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.1: Project successfully initialized with Docusaurus classic-typescript template. Development server confirmed working. Build process successful after fixing broken links and MDX compilation errors.

### Tech Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Frontend Framework**: Docusaurus 3.4.0 with React 18.3.1 for static site generation
- **Frontend Language**: TypeScript 5.5.3 for static typing
- **Styling**: Infima CSS Framework (bundled with Docusaurus) for consistent UI
- **Package Manager**: npm 10.8.1 for dependency management
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages for static website hosting

### Project Structure Context

Key file locations for this story:

- Main configuration: `docusaurus.config.ts` (project root)
- Static assets: `/static` directory for logos and images
- Custom styling: `src/css/custom.css` for global custom styling

### Component Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/components.md]

- **UI & Presentation Layer**: Provides visual presentation based on Infima framework
- **Docusaurus Build Engine**: Compiles content and configuration into optimized static website using React, Webpack, Node.js
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Development server: `npm start`

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **Global Styling**: All global custom styling must be done in `src/css/custom.css`
- **Static Assets**: All assets must be placed in the `/static` directory
- **Configuration**: Use TypeScript in `docusaurus.config.ts`

### Configuration Structure Context

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

- Configuration should use TypeScript with proper typing
- Routing handled automatically by Docusaurus's file-based routing system
- Static site generation means no API client setup required for MVP

### Testing

**Testing Requirements for this story**:

- **Manual Testing**: Verify visual changes render correctly in development server
- **Build Testing**: Ensure `npm run build` completes without errors
- **E2E Manual Process**: Follow checklist to test branding consistency across pages
- **No Unit Tests Required**: Configuration and styling changes don't require component unit tests
