## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.1: Project successfully initialized with Docusaurus classic-typescript template. Development server confirmed working. Build process successful after fixing broken links and MDX compilation errors.

### Tech Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Frontend Framework**: Docusaurus 3.4.0 with React 18.3.1 for static site generation
- **Frontend Language**: TypeScript 5.5.3 for static typing
- **Styling**: Infima CSS Framework (bundled with Docusaurus) for consistent UI
- **Package Manager**: npm 10.8.1 for dependency management
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages for static website hosting

### Project Structure Context

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

Key file locations for this story:

- Main configuration: `docusaurus.config.ts` (project root)
- Static assets: `/static` directory for logos and images
- Custom styling: `src/css/custom.css` for global custom styling

### Component Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/components.md]

- **UI & Presentation Layer**: Provides visual presentation based on Infima framework
- **Docusaurus Build Engine**: Compiles content and configuration into optimized static website using React, Webpack, Node.js
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Development server: `npm start`

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **Global Styling**: All global custom styling must be done in `src/css/custom.css`
- **Static Assets**: All assets must be placed in the `/static` directory
- **Configuration**: Use TypeScript in `docusaurus.config.ts`

### Configuration Structure Context

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

- Configuration should use TypeScript with proper typing
- Routing handled automatically by Docusaurus's file-based routing system
- Static site generation means no API client setup required for MVP

### Testing

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Requirements for this story**:

- **Manual Testing**: Verify visual changes render correctly in development server
- **Build Testing**: Ensure `npm run build` completes without errors
- **E2E Manual Process**: Follow checklist to test branding consistency across pages
- **No Unit Tests Required**: Configuration and styling changes don't require component unit tests

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-16
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
Excellent implementation of team branding and site configuration. The developer successfully updated all critical branding elements with official team colors from the front-end specification. The implementation demonstrates good understanding of Docusaurus configuration patterns and CSS custom properties. Minor improvements made to enhance brand consistency across light and dark themes.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: docusaurus.config.ts
  - **Change**: Updated social card image from default Docusaurus image to team logo
  - **Why**: Default template image was not brand-appropriate for social media sharing
  - **How**: Changed image reference to use actual team logo for consistent brand representation

- **File**: src/css/custom.css
  - **Change**: Enhanced brand consistency with navbar and footer background color variables
  - **Why**: Further strengthen brand cohesion across all site elements
  - **How**: Added CSS custom properties for navbar and footer background colors using existing brand colors

- **File**: src/css/custom.css
  - **Change**: Improved dark mode theme with proper background colors for brand consistency
  - **Why**: Dark mode implementation was missing specific background color definitions
  - **How**: Added dark mode background colors to maintain brand consistency in both light and dark themes

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ All custom styling properly placed in src/css/custom.css; logo correctly in static directory
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows unified project structure with assets in correct locations
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Manual testing approach appropriate; build verification successful
- All ACs Met: ✓ Site title/tagline updated, logo replaced, color scheme matches brand specification exactly

### Improvements Checklist
[All critical items handled during review]

- [x] Enhanced social media card branding (docusaurus.config.ts)
- [x] Improved navbar background consistency (src/css/custom.css)
- [x] Enhanced footer background branding (src/css/custom.css)
- [x] Strengthened dark mode brand consistency (src/css/custom.css)
- [x] Verified all brand colors match front-end specification exactly

### Security Review
No security concerns identified. All branding assets properly placed in static directory. Social media card now uses appropriate team logo instead of generic template image.

### Performance Considerations
Brand color implementations use efficient CSS custom properties for optimal performance. Logo file is appropriately sized PNG format. No performance impact from branding changes.

### Technical Notes
- All brand colors from front-end-spec.md correctly implemented: Primary (#242E6B), Secondary (#C1A5F3), Accent (#FBC941)
- Light theme background (#FDF5E4) and content color (#212529) properly configured
- Dark mode implementation enhanced for better brand consistency
- Logo.png successfully referenced and displaying correctly in navbar and as favicon
- Build warnings about broken markdown links are pre-existing and unrelated to this story

### Final Status
✓ Approved - Ready for Done

Branding implementation is comprehensive and professional. Team identity is now properly represented across all site elements with excellent attention to brand consistency in both light and dark themes.
