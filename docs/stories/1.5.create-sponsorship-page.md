## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.4: Core content pages (About and Contact) successfully created and added to navigation. Site branding and navigation structure well established. Homepage customization completed. Development server confirmed working at http://localhost:3000/ with build process functioning correctly. Navigation structure working well in docusaurus.config.ts with logical ordering.

### Tech Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Frontend Framework**: Docusaurus 3.4.0 with React 18.3.1 for static site generation
- **Frontend Language**: TypeScript 5.5.3 for static typing
- **Styling**: Infima CSS Framework (bundled with Docusaurus) for consistent UI
- **Package Manager**: npm 10.8.1 for dependency management

### Project Structure Context

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

Key file locations for this story:

- New Sponsorship page: `src/pages/sponsorship.md` (standard Docusaurus page location)
- Navigation configuration: `docusaurus.config.ts` (main site configuration file)
- Custom global styling: `src/css/custom.css` (for any custom styling overrides)

### Component Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

- **Route Organization**: Routing is handled automatically by Docusaurus's file-based routing system in the `src/pages` directory
- **Page Template**: All new pages should use Markdown format with proper frontmatter for page metadata
- **Navigation**: Navigation items are configured in the main `docusaurus.config.ts` configuration file
- **Component Template**: Pages should be functional components using TypeScript and React Hooks if React components are needed

### Data Models Context

[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

- **Sponsor Data Model**: For future reference, if sponsor data needs to be displayed:
  - `name`: string - The official name of the sponsor
  - `logoUrl`: string - The path to the sponsor's logo image file
  - `website`: string - A link to the sponsor's website
  - `sponsorshipLevel`: string - The sponsorship tier (e.g., 'Gold', 'Silver')

### Frontend Architecture Details

[Source: architecture/components.md]

- **Content Management Component**: Content is managed via filesystem using `.md` files in the Git repository
- **UI & Presentation Layer**: Provides visual presentation based on Infima framework
- **Docusaurus Build Engine**: Compiles content and configuration into optimized static website

### Core Workflows Context

[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]

- **Sponsor Inquiry Workflow**: The sponsorship page should facilitate the sponsor inquiry workflow by directing users to the contact page where they can reach out to the team

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **Global Styling**: All global custom styling must be done in `src/css/custom.css`
- **Static Assets**: All assets must be placed in the `/static` directory
- **MDX Usage**: Use `.mdx` extension for Markdown files that contain React components (but standard `.md` is fine for simple content pages)

### Configuration Context

[Source: previous story experience and docusaurus.config.ts structure]

The `docusaurus.config.ts` file contains the main navigation configuration in the `themeConfig.navbar.items` array. New pages should be added to this navigation structure following the existing pattern established in previous stories.

### Testing

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Requirements for this story**:

- **Manual Testing**: Verify sponsorship page renders correctly in development server
- **Build Testing**: Ensure `npm run build` completes without errors
- **E2E Manual Process**: Test navigation links and verify content displays properly, test call-to-action links
- **No Unit Tests Required**: Simple content pages don't require component unit tests for MVP
