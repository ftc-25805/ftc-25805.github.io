# Story 2.3: Re-architect Resources Section

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** team member,
**I want** the Resources section to be a multi-page guide with sidebar navigation,
**so that** I can easily find and browse tutorials and documents.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The existing single "Resources" page is removed.
2. The Docusaurus `docs` plugin is configured to serve as the new Resources section.
3. Content is organized into categories that appear in the sidebar.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.2: The project now has a fully implemented dark theme as the default with Epic 2 color specifications (#b377d1 purple primary, #f1c40f yellow accent). All new content should automatically inherit these theme variables through Infima's CSS system. The dark theme uses proper WCAG 2.1 AA compliant contrast ratios.

### Tech Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md]

- **Framework**: Docusaurus ^3.x for static site generation with built-in docs plugin support
- **Language**: TypeScript ^5.x for configuration files
- **Styling**: CSS Modules + Infima for component styling and theme management (maintains dark theme consistency)

### Current Docusaurus Configuration Context

[Source: docusaurus.config.ts analysis]

**Existing Docs Plugin Configuration**: The docs plugin is already configured (lines 39-45) with:

- `sidebarPath: './sidebars.ts'` - sidebar configuration file
- Edit URL pointing to GitHub repository
- Currently serves content from `/docs` directory

**Current Navbar Configuration**:

- Existing "Tutorial" link (lines 88-93) with `type: 'docSidebar'` and `sidebarId: 'tutorialSidebar'`
- Current `/resources` link (line 87) points to existing single page

**Required Configuration Changes**:

1. Update navbar "Tutorial" link to "Resources" label
2. Ensure docs plugin serves appropriate content for resources
3. Remove existing `/resources` navbar link or redirect it

### Sidebar Configuration Context

[Source: sidebars.ts analysis]

**Current Sidebar Setup**: Currently uses autogenerated sidebar from docs folder structure:

```typescript
tutorialSidebar: [{ type: "autogenerated", dirName: "." }];
```

**Required Changes for Resource Categories**:

- Need to create manual sidebar structure for organized categories
- Categories should match the content organization from current resources.mdx:
  - Programming Guides
  - Build and Design Resources
  - Competition Strategy
  - Team Development
  - Community Resources

### Current Resources Content Analysis

[Source: src/pages/resources.mdx analysis]

**Content Structure to Migrate**:

- Programming Guides: Getting Started & Advanced Programming sections
- Build and Design Resources: Mechanical Design & Electronics sections
- Competition Strategy: Game Strategy section
- Video Tutorials: Programming Tutorial Series with YouTubeEmbed component
- Team Development: Project Management & Teamwork sections
- Community Resources: Forums, Local Events sections

**Special Components Used**:

- `YouTubeEmbed` component import: `import YouTubeEmbed from '@site/src/components/YouTubeEmbed';`
- Video embed usage: `<YouTubeEmbed videoId="hbnBxBD23qM" title="Computer Vision for Beginners: No-Code Color Tracking (Limelight 3A)" />`

### Project Structure Context

[Source: architecture/project-structure.md]

**Current Structure**: Project uses docs directory for BMad planning documents
**Required New Structure for Resources**:

- `docs/resources/` - New resource content directory (separate from BMad docs)
- Subdirectories for each category of resources
- Maintain existing `docs/` structure for BMad planning documents

**File Location Requirements**:

- New resource files: `docs/resources/{category}/{filename}.md`
- Sidebar configuration: `sidebars.ts` (existing file)
- Main configuration: `docusaurus.config.ts` (existing file)
- Remove: `src/pages/resources.mdx`

### Component Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/component-standards.md]

**YouTubeEmbed Component Integration**: The existing YouTubeEmbed component should work in docs markdown:

- Component is already created at `src/components/YouTubeEmbed.tsx`
- Can be imported in docs markdown files using MDX syntax
- Maintains existing props structure: `videoId` and `title`

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-requirements.md]

**Testing Focus Areas**:

- Content migration verification (no content loss)
- Component functionality in new context (YouTubeEmbed in docs)
- Navigation and routing functionality
- Responsive design with new sidebar layout

**Testing Strategy**:

- Manual content comparison between old and new structure
- Functional testing of YouTube embeds in new location
- Navigation testing for sidebar functionality
- Responsive testing for mobile sidebar behavior
