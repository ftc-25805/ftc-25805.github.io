## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.6: Resources page successfully created and added to navigation. Site branding and navigation structure well established. Development server confirmed working at http://localhost:3000/ with build process functioning correctly. Navigation structure working well in docusaurus.config.ts with logical ordering between About, Sponsorship, Contact, and Resources.

### Tech Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Frontend Framework**: Docusaurus 3.4.0 with React 18.3.1 for static site generation
- **Frontend Language**: TypeScript 5.5.3 for static typing
- **Styling**: Infima CSS Framework (bundled with Docusaurus) for consistent UI
- **Package Manager**: npm 10.8.1 for dependency management

### Project Structure Context

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

Key file locations for this story:

- **Blog posts directory**: `/blog/` (contains all blog posts as Markdown files)
- **Main configuration**: `docusaurus.config.ts` (main site configuration file where blog is enabled)
- **Custom styling**: `src/css/custom.css` (for any custom blog styling overrides)
- **Static assets**: `/static` directory (for any blog post images or assets)

### Data Models Context

[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

**BlogPost Structure** to follow for frontmatter:

- `title`: string - The main title of the blog post
- `date`: string - The publication date (e.g., '2025-08-15')
- `author`: string - The name of the team member who wrote the post
- `tags`: string[] - A list of relevant tags (e.g., ['build-season', 'competition'])
- `slug`: string - The URL-friendly version of the title
- `draft`: boolean - If true, the post will not be published to the live site

### Component Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/components.md]

- **Content Management Component**: Content is managed via filesystem using `.md` files in the Git repository
- **Docusaurus Build Engine**: Compiles content and configuration into optimized static website
- **UI & Presentation Layer**: Provides visual presentation based on Infima framework

### Frontend Architecture Details

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

- **Route Organization**: Routing is handled automatically by Docusaurus's file-based routing system
- **Component Template**: Blog posts use Markdown format with frontmatter for metadata
- **State Management**: Standard React hooks used for any interactive blog components

### Core Workflows Context

[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]

- **Content Publishing Workflow**: Blog posts follow the standard content publishing workflow where content is managed via Markdown files and automatically deployed through GitHub Actions

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **Global Styling**: All global custom styling must be done in `src/css/custom.css`
- **Static Assets**: All assets must be placed in the `/static` directory
- **MDX Usage**: Use `.mdx` extension for blog posts that contain React components (but standard `.md` is fine for simple blog posts)

### Configuration Context

[Source: previous story experience and docusaurus.config.ts structure]

The `docusaurus.config.ts` file contains the main blog configuration and navigation configuration in the `themeConfig.navbar.items` array. The Blog link should be added to this navigation structure following the existing pattern established in previous stories, positioned logically in the navigation order after Resources.

### Testing

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Requirements for this story**:

- **Manual Testing**: Verify blog feature works correctly in development server
- **Build Testing**: Ensure `npm run build` completes without errors
- **E2E Manual Process**: Test blog navigation links, verify blog post displays properly, test blog list functionality
- **No Unit Tests Required**: Simple blog setup doesn't require component unit tests for MVP
