## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.2: Site configuration and branding completed successfully. Development server working at http://localhost:3000/. Build process confirmed working. Official brand colors implemented in custom.css. Site title and tagline already configured for Reprogrammed team.

### Tech Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Frontend Framework**: Docusaurus 3.4.0 with React 18.3.1 for static site generation
- **Frontend Language**: TypeScript 5.5.3 for static typing
- **Styling**: Infima CSS Framework (bundled with Docusaurus) for consistent UI
- **Package Manager**: npm 10.8.1 for dependency management

### Project Structure Context

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

Key file locations for this story:

- Homepage main file: `src/pages/index.tsx` (main homepage component)
- Homepage features component: `src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.tsx`
- Homepage features styling: `src/components/HomepageFeatures/styles.module.css`
- Homepage main styling: `src/pages/index.module.css`
- Custom global styling: `src/css/custom.css` (for any global style overrides)

### Component Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

- **Component Template**: All components should be functional components using TypeScript and React Hooks
- **Component Organization**: Custom React components should be in `src/components` directory
- **State Management**: Use standard React hooks for state management (no third-party state management needed)
- **Routing**: Docusaurus handles routing automatically via file-based routing system

### Frontend Architecture Details

[Source: architecture/components.md]

- **UI & Presentation Layer**: Provides visual presentation based on Infima framework
- **Content Management**: Content managed via filesystem and Git workflow using .md/.mdx files
- **Docusaurus Build Engine**: Compiles content and configuration into optimized static website using React, Webpack, Node.js

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **Global Styling**: All global custom styling must be done in `src/css/custom.css`
- **Static Assets**: All assets must be placed in the `/static` directory
- **Component Naming**: Use PascalCase for component names
- **MDX Usage**: Use `.mdx` extension for Markdown files that contain React components

### Current Homepage Structure Analysis

Based on file review, the current homepage (src/pages/index.tsx) contains:

- HomepageHeader function with hero banner displaying site title and tagline
- Current button links to "/docs/architecture" with "Docusaurus Tutorial" text
- HomepageFeatures component showing default Docusaurus features
- Layout component providing page structure and meta tags

The HomepageFeatures component (src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.tsx) currently displays:

- Three default Docusaurus feature cards: "Easy to Use", "Focus on What Matters", "Powered by React"
- Uses SVG icons from static/img/ directory
- Grid layout with three columns

### Testing

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Requirements for this story**:

- **Manual Testing**: Verify visual changes render correctly in development server
- **Build Testing**: Ensure `npm run build` completes without errors
- **E2E Manual Process**: Follow checklist to test navigation links and content display
- **No Unit Tests Required**: Homepage content changes don't require component unit tests for MVP
