# Story 1.1: Project Initialization

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** team member,
**I want** to initialize the project from the Docusaurus starter template,
**so that** I have a working baseline for the website.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The project is created from the 'classic-typescript' template.
2. All dependencies are installed successfully.
3. The local development server runs without errors.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Set up Docusaurus project from template (AC: 1)
  - [x] Run `npx create-docusaurus@latest . classic-typescript` to initialize the project
  - [x] Verify the project structure matches the expected Docusaurus template structure
- [x] Task 2: Install project dependencies (AC: 2)
  - [x] Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies
  - [x] Verify no dependency conflicts or errors during installation
  - [x] Confirm TypeScript version 5.5.3 is installed as specified in tech stack
- [x] Task 3: Start and verify development server (AC: 3)
  - [x] Run `npm start` to start the local development server
  - [x] Verify the server starts without errors on default port
  - [x] Confirm the default Docusaurus homepage loads successfully in browser
  - [x] Test hot reload functionality by making a minor change

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

No previous stories - this is the first story in Epic 1.

### Tech Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Frontend Framework**: Docusaurus 3.4.0 with React 18.3.1 for static site generation
- **Frontend Language**: TypeScript 5.5.3 for static typing
- **Styling**: Infima CSS Framework (bundled with Docusaurus) for consistent UI
- **Package Manager**: npm 10.8.1 for dependency management
- **Testing**: Jest 29.7.0 / React Testing Library for unit testing custom components

### Project Structure Alignment

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
The initialized project should follow this structure:

```
reprogrammed-website/
├── .docusaurus/      # Docusaurus build cache (auto-generated)
├── .github/          # Automation workflows
├── blog/             # Contains all blog posts as Markdown files
├── docs/             # BMad project documents (brief.md, prd.md, etc.)
├── src/              # All source code and custom components
│   ├── components/   # Shared, custom React components
│   ├── css/          # Custom styling and Infima overrides
│   ├── pages/        # Custom pages (e.g., sponsorship, contact)
│   └── theme/        # Overridden theme components (swizzling)
├── static/           # Static assets like logos and images
├── docusaurus.config.ts # The main site configuration file
├── package.json      # Project dependencies and scripts
└── README.md         # Project's main README file
```

### Component Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

- All custom React components should be located in `src/components` directory
- Components should be functional components using TypeScript and React Hooks
- Component template structure:

```typescript
import React from 'react';

type MyComponentProps = {
  title: string;
};

export default function MyComponent({ title }: MyComponentProps): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      {/* Component JSX goes here */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **Global Styling**: All global custom styling must be done in `src/css/custom.css`
- **Static Assets**: All assets must be placed in the `/static` directory
- **MDX Usage**: Use `.mdx` extension for Markdown files containing React components
- **Component Naming**: PascalCase (e.g., `SponsorCard.tsx`)
- **Hook Naming**: camelCase with `use` prefix (e.g., `useSponsors.ts`)

### Build and Deployment Context

[Source: architecture/components.md]

- Docusaurus Build Engine compiles Markdown, React components into optimized static website
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Development server: `npm start`
- The build system uses Webpack and Node.js environment

### Testing

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
**Testing Requirements for this story**:

- **Unit Tests**: Use Jest and React Testing Library for custom components
- **Test Location**: Test files should be co-located with components
- **E2E Tests**: Manual process for MVP following checklist for critical user flows
- **Testing Structure**: Component Unit Tests (no complex testing needed for basic initialization)
