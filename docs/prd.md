# Reprogrammed Team Website Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### **Goals and Background Context**

#### **Goals**

- To attract at least 3 new sponsors during the current FTC season.
- To establish a professional online presence that legitimizes the team for potential partners.
- To significantly reduce the time it takes for team members to find educational and organizational resources.
- To create a central, public-facing hub for sharing team progress and knowledge with the school and FTC communities.

#### **Background Context**

The Reprogrammed FTC team currently lacks a dedicated website, which presents challenges for both external outreach and internal operations. Potential sponsors expect a professional website to reference, and its absence creates a barrier to securing new funding. Internally, critical resources are scattered across emails and group chats, making it difficult for team members to find the information they need efficiently. This PRD outlines the requirements for a website that will solve these issues by creating a single, organized source of truth for the team.

2.  The website must display detailed sponsorship levels and team needs to attract partners.
3.  The website must provide a clear contact method for potential sponsors.
4.  The website must include a blog/news section for sharing team progress and updates.
5.  The website must feature a resource section where educational guides and YouTube videos can be organized and accessed.
6.  The website layout must be responsive and function correctly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

3.  The website must be performant, with fast page load times characteristic of a static site.
4.  Content for the website (blog posts, resources, etc.) must be manageable by team members via Markdown files within a Git repository.

### **User Interface Design Goals**

#### **Overall UX Vision**

The website should project a professional, clean, and engaging image that is appealing to both corporate sponsors and student members. Navigation should be intuitive, allowing all user types to find the information they need quickly and efficiently.

#### **Key Interaction Paradigms**

The site will use standard and familiar web interaction patterns. A persistent top-navigation bar will provide access to the primary sections. Key "call-to-action" buttons, such as "Become a Sponsor," will be prominently displayed.

#### **Core Screens and Views**

Based on the MVP scope, the following conceptual screens are required to deliver the core functionality:

- Homepage
- About Page (Mission Statement)
- Sponsorship Page
- Resources Page
- Blog/News Page
- Contact Page

#### **Accessibility**

- **Assumption**: The site should meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards, a common accessibility target that ensures the site is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities.

#### **Branding**

- **Assumption**: The design will need to incorporate the Reprogrammed team's existing branding (e.g., logo, team colors, specific fonts). Please provide any existing style guides or brand assets.

#### **Target Device and Platforms**

- The website will be **Web Responsive**, ensuring a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

### **Technical Assumptions**

- **Starter Template**: The project will be initialized using the official Docusaurus 'classic-typescript' starter template.
- **Repository Structure**: A **Monorepo** structure will be used, as the entire project will be contained within a single Docusaurus repository provided by the template.
- **Service Architecture**: The project will utilize a **Static Site Architecture**, generating static files for hosting.
- **Testing Requirements**: For the MVP, **Unit Testing** will be required for any custom React components created.
- **Additional Technical Assumptions**: The project will be built using the **Docusaurus framework with TypeScript** and deployed and hosted on **GitHub Pages**.
