Of course. I have reviewed the new project brief for the "Phase 2 Enhancement" and will now update the existing PRD to reflect the new scope of work.

This update will include a new epic to capture the required enhancements, such as the site-wide dark theme, the homepage revamp, the restructuring of the Resources page, and the expansion of the "About the Team" page.

Here is the updated Product Requirements Document for your review.

### **Goals and Background Context**

#### **Goals**

- To attract at least 3 new sponsors during the current FTC season.
- To establish a professional, modern, and engaging online presence that legitimizes the team for potential partners.
- To significantly reduce the time it takes for team members to find educational and organizational resources through a restructured, multi-page guide.
- To create a central, public-facing hub for sharing team progress and knowledge with the school and FTC communities.
- To better showcase the talented individuals on the team, including members, mentors, and alumni, to foster a stronger community connection.

#### **Background Context**

The Reprogrammed FTC team website currently serves as a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP). While successful in establishing a baseline presence, it lacks the professional polish and engaging features necessary to meet the team's evolving goals. The current design is visually uninspired and does not fully capture the team's innovative spirit. This second phase of development aims to address these shortcomings by implementing a comprehensive visual and structural redesign. This will transform the website into a powerful tool for sponsorship, recruitment, and community engagement.

### **Requirements**

#### **Functional**

1.  [cite_start]The website must display the team's mission statement and history. [cite: 442]
2.  [cite_start]The website must display detailed sponsorship levels and team needs to attract partners. [cite: 442]
3.  [cite_start]The website must provide a clear contact method for potential sponsors. [cite: 442]
4.  [cite_start]The website must include a blog/news section for sharing team progress and updates. [cite: 442]
5.  [cite_start]The website must feature a resource section where educational guides and YouTube videos can be organized and accessed. [cite: 442]
6.  [cite_start]The website layout must be responsive and function correctly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. [cite: 442]
7.  **New:** The homepage must be redesigned to feature a robot spotlight, a description of the FTC program, and a component to showcase sponsors.
8.  **New:** The Resources page must be re-architected into a multi-page guide using a sidebar for navigation.
9.  **New:** The "About" page must be expanded to include dedicated sections for current team members, mentors, and alumni.

#### **Non-Functional**

1.  [cite_start]The website shall be built as a static site using Docusaurus and TypeScript. [cite: 442]
2.  [cite_start]The website shall be hosted on GitHub Pages. [cite: 442]
3.  [cite_start]The website must be performant, with fast page load times characteristic of a static site. [cite: 442]
4.  [cite_start]Content for the website (blog posts, resources, etc.) must be manageable by team members via Markdown files within a Git repository. [cite: 442]
5.  **New:** A "clean, modern, fun, innovative" dark theme with colorful accents shall be applied consistently across the entire website.

### **User Interface Design Goals**

#### **Overall UX Vision**

[cite_start]The website should project a professional, clean, and engaging image that is appealing to both corporate sponsors and student members. [cite: 447] The enhanced design will feature a modern dark theme with colorful accents to better reflect the team's innovative and fun personality. [cite_start]Navigation should be intuitive, allowing all user types to find the information they need quickly and efficiently. [cite: 447]

#### **Key Interaction Paradigms**

[cite_start]The site will use standard and familiar web interaction patterns. [cite: 447] [cite_start]A persistent top-navigation bar will provide access to the primary sections. [cite: 447] [cite_start]Key "call-to-action" buttons, such as "Become a Sponsor," will be prominently displayed. [cite: 447]

#### **Core Screens and Views**

Based on the project scope, the following conceptual screens are required:

- Homepage (Redesigned)
- About Page (Expanded with Member, Mentor, Alumni sections)
- Sponsorship Page

#### **Target Device and Platforms**

### **Technical Assumptions**
