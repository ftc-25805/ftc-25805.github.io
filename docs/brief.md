# Project Brief: Reprogrammed Team Website (Phase 2 Enhancement)

### **Executive Summary**

This project brief outlines the second phase of development for the Reprogrammed FTC team website. The primary goal is to enhance the existing MVP by improving the site's overall look and feel, redesigning key pages for better user engagement, and refining the team's brand identity. Key initiatives include revamping the homepage with more dynamic content, restructuring the resources page into an organized, multi-page guide, and expanding the "About" page to showcase team members, mentors, and alumni. The successful completion of this phase will result in a more professional, modern, and engaging online presence, aimed at attracting new sponsors and better serving the needs of the team and the wider FTC community.

### **Problem Statement**

While the current Reprogrammed FTC team website serves as a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP), it lacks the professional polish and engaging features necessary to meet the team's primary goals. The homepage is visually uninspired and fails to immediately capture the team's innovative spirit, potentially deterring new sponsors. Key internal resources are functional but disorganized, leading to inefficiency for team members. Furthermore, the site's current state does not adequately showcase the talented individuals who make up the team, missing an opportunity to connect with the community and alumni. This project aims to address these shortcomings to create a website that not only functions as an information hub but also acts as a powerful tool for sponsorship, recruitment, and community engagement.

### **Proposed Solution**

Our proposed solution is a strategic enhancement of the existing team website, focusing on a comprehensive visual and structural redesign. We will overhaul the user experience by implementing a clean, modern, and innovative dark theme with colorful accents to better reflect the team's personality. Key pages will be rebuilt: the homepage will feature more dynamic content, including a robot spotlight and sponsor showcase; the resources section will be re-architected into a scalable, multi-page tutorial format using Docusaurus's native docs functionality; and the "About" page will be expanded with dedicated components for team members, mentors, and alumni. This approach will transform the website into a professional and engaging platform that effectively supports the team's goals for sponsorship and community-building.

  - **Hosting/Infrastructure**: The website will continue to be hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

- **Architecture Considerations**
  - **Repository Structure**: The project will maintain its **Monorepo** structure within a single Docusaurus repository.
  - **Service Architecture**: The project will continue to utilize a **Static Site Architecture**.
  - **Accessibility Compliance**: The site should continue to meet **WCAG 2.1 AA standards**.

### **Constraints & Assumptions**

- **Constraints**

  - **Budget**: There is no budget allocated for this project.
  - **Timeline**: The goal is to complete this enhancement project during the current FTC season to support sponsor outreach.
  - **Resources**: Development will be handled by student team members and mentors.
  - **Technical**: All development must be compatible with the existing Docusaurus, TypeScript, and GitHub Pages technology stack.

- **Key Assumptions**
  - Team members will be available to provide content (e.g., bios, project descriptions, sponsor logos) in a timely manner.
  - The team has access to and will provide any necessary brand assets (e.g., high-resolution logos, specific color codes).
  - The Docusaurus framework is capable of supporting all the desired visual and functional enhancements.

### **Risks & Open Questions**

- **Key Risks**

  - **Team Availability**: As a student-run project, development progress may slow down significantly during peak build-season or due to school-related commitments.
  - **Content Bottleneck**: The completion of several components depends on the timely delivery of content (text, photos, logos) from the team.
  - **Scope Creep**: The enthusiasm from our brainstorming session could lead to adding extra features beyond the defined scope, delaying the core enhancements.

- **Open Questions**

  - What is the long-term plan for website maintenance and content updates?
  - What specific analytics tools, if any, will be implemented to track the KPIs?
  - Do we have a complete set of brand assets (high-resolution logos, fonts, color palette) ready for the redesign?

- **Areas Needing Further Research**
  - A brief review of top-tier FTC/FRC team websites to gather inspiration for the "colorful dark theme."
  - Investigation into existing Docusaurus components or plugins that could accelerate the development of the new features.

### **Next Steps**
