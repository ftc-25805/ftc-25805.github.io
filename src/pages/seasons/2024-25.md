## Robot Development Process

Our robot design process follows a systematic approach integrated with our competition strategy:

1. **Game Analysis** - Study the challenge and identify key scoring opportunities
2. **Strategy Development** - Define our competition strategy and robot requirements
3. **Concept Design** - Brainstorm and evaluate different design concepts
4. **Prototyping** - Build and test critical mechanisms
5. **CAD Design** - Create detailed 3D models using OnShape
6. **Build & Assembly** - Construct the robot using quality materials and techniques
7. **Programming** - Develop autonomous and teleop control software
8. **Testing & Iteration** - Continuous testing and improvement throughout the season

## Competition Strategy

Our competition approach focuses on:

**Autonomous Period**

- Reliable and consistent autonomous routines
- Strategic scoring to maximize points
- Adaptable programming for different alliance partners

**Driver-Controlled Period**
