# About Team Reprogrammed

## Our Mission

Team Reprogrammed (FTC #25805) is dedicated to inspiring innovation, fostering collaboration, and building the next generation of engineers and problem-solvers through the exciting world of robotics.

## Our Values

### Engineering Excellence
We strive for technical precision and creative problem-solving in every aspect of our robotics design and programming.

### Team Collaboration  
Success comes through working together, sharing knowledge, and supporting each other's growth and learning.

### FIRST Values
We embrace the core principles of FIRST - Gracious Professionalism, Coopetition, and making a positive impact in our community.

## Our Journey

Team Reprogrammed was founded with the vision of creating an inclusive environment where students can explore STEM fields through hands-on robotics challenges. We participate in the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC), where we design, build, and program robots to compete in seasonal competitions.

Our team members bring diverse backgrounds and skills, from mechanical engineering and programming to business development and community outreach. Together, we work to push the boundaries of what's possible while having fun and learning from every challenge.

## What We Do

- **Design & Build**: Create innovative mechanical systems and robust robot designs
- **Programming**: Develop autonomous and teleop control systems using Java and Android Studio
- **Community Outreach**: Share our passion for STEM with younger students and the broader community
- **Competition**: Compete in regional and state-level FTC tournaments
- **Learning**: Continuously expand our technical and soft skills through mentorship and practice
