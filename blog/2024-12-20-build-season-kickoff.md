## Game Analysis Complete

Over the past few weeks, we've conducted a thorough analysis of this year's game:

- **Strategic Priorities**: We've identified the key scoring opportunities and developed our competition strategy
- **Robot Requirements**: Our engineering team has defined the technical specifications for our robot
- **Timeline Planning**: We've created a detailed schedule to ensure we're ready for competitions

## Design Phase Progress

Our mechanical and programming teams have been collaborating on initial designs:

### Mechanical Design

- Completed initial CAD concepts for our main mechanisms
- Prototyped key subsystems to validate our approach
- Selected drive base configuration for optimal field navigation

### Programming Framework

- Set up our development environment with the latest FTC SDK
- Created base robot control structure
- Began work on autonomous routine framework

## Team Preparation

The entire team has been preparing for the intense build season ahead:

- **Skills Training**: All members completed safety training and tool certification
- **Role Assignments**: We've organized into specialized sub-teams for maximum efficiency
- **Meeting Schedule**: Increased meeting frequency to 4 times per week

## Looking Ahead

The next phase of our build season will focus on:

1. **Detailed Design**: Finalizing CAD models and component specifications
2. **Procurement**: Ordering materials and components for construction
3. **Prototyping**: Building and testing key mechanisms
4. **Programming**: Developing autonomous and teleop control systems

We're excited about this year's challenge and can't wait to see our robot come to life. Follow our blog for weekly updates on our progress!
