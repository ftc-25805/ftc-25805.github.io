## Season Highlights at a Glance

Our 2024-25 season was packed with achievements, challenges, and growth:

- **üèÜ Regional Champions** - Qualified for State Championship
- **üéØ Technical Excellence** - Robot performed consistently across all competitions
- **ü§ù Community Impact** - Reached over 500 students through outreach programs
- **üìà Team Growth** - Expanded from 12 to 18 dedicated team members
- **üí° Innovation** - Developed unique autonomous strategies that set us apart

## Robot Evolution - From Concept to Champion

### Final Robot Specs
Our final robot, affectionately named "Phoenix," exceeded all our design expectations:

**Key Features:**
- **Drive System**: Mecanum drive with precise field-centric control
- **Intake Mechanism**: Custom 3D-printed intake with 95% game element pickup success rate
- **Scoring System**: Dual-stage lift capable of reaching all scoring positions
- **Autonomous Performance**: Consistent 40+ point autonomous routines

### Design Iterations
We went through three major design iterations this season:

1. **Prototype Alpha** (December): Initial proof-of-concept with basic mechanisms
2. **Beta Build** (February): Refined design with improved reliability and scoring speed
3. **Competition Ready** (March): Final optimization for consistency and driver control

Each iteration taught us valuable lessons about engineering trade-offs, manufacturing precision, and the importance of thorough testing.
